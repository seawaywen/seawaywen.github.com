A programmer based in Beijing, China, I love programming and am especially addicted to <span style="color:#859900;">*Python*</span> language. 

I have worked on various projects (such as web apps, mobiles apps, etc) by using different technologies (such as <span style="color:#2aa198;">*Java*</span>, <span style="color:#859900;">*Python*</span>, <span style="color:#268bd2;">*Objective-C*</span>, <span style="color:#b58900;">*JavaScript*</span>, etc).

# Summary

With 8 years experience in software development and maintenance, I'm able to deliver complex software applications, from design, development, build, release, to the final deployment by following the rational principles and processes, either work independently or lead a team.

When I began my career, I worked as a Java developer and I believed that Java was the promising direction for me to pursue, until I touched the script language - <span style="color:#859900;">*Python*</span>, I was deeply impressed by its beauty of simplicity. [Django][django] became my favorite web framework and I found some libraries really great in project, such as [Tastypie][tastypie], [South][south], [Fabric][fabric], [Haystack][haystack], etc.

With time goes by, the front end of web app is getting more and more important and popular. With this trend, the JavaScript acquires its dominant role accordingly. For instance, [JQuery][jquery] is a swiss army knife and [Underscore][underscore] is quite handy as an utility-belt library. At the same time, even some frontend MVC frameworks were created, such as [Backbone][backbone]. 

The web application becomes more and more complex with the increasing files, and you may, one day, find that orgnizing your JavaScript file with [AMD][amd] is a wise choice in the project.

Three years ago, I happened to step into the Mac world via my first iOS project, and I started to enjoy the elegant framework - [Cocoa][cocoa] by learning the Objective-C. From the iOS projects, I learned a lot of novel and advanced knowledges which have greatly extended my experience in my career.
