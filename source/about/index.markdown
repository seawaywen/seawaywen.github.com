# Summary

I am a programmer with 8 years' software development and maintenance experience. I'm able to work independently or lead a team to deliver the complex software applications from design, development, build, release to the final deployment with the rational principles and processes.

I worked as a Java developer for years on the web applications from the beginning of my career and I thought that was the direction for a developer like me util I touched script lanaguage - Python, everything started changing - Simpler and Beautiful. [Django][django] is my favorite web framework, with some great libraries: [Tastypie][tastypie], [South][south], [Fabric][fabric], [Haystack][haystack], etc.

With time goes by, the front end of web app is getting more and more important and popular. It means the Javascript plays the key role at this position. [JQuery][jquery] is a swiss army knife and [Underscore][underscore] is quite useful to manipulate the list object. At the same time, even some frontend MVC frameworks were created, such as [Backbone][backbone]. 

You application is getting more and more complex with the increasing files, some days later, you will find that orgnize your javascript file with [AMD][amd] is a wise choice in the project.

In the web developement world, one day I happened to get a change to embrace the Mac world - my first iOS project, I started to enjoy the elegant framework - Cocoa by learning the Objective-C. From the iOS projects, I learnt a lot of new knowledge, and that extended my experience.
