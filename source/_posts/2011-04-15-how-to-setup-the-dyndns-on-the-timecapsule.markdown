I've bought the Dynamic DNS service from [DynDNS](http://www.dyndns.com), and I'd like the host my own Mac mini with this service, so that I can access my server out of home.

I hsot my home network with TimeCapsule which is Apple's router product.

I refer to the following link to setup DynDNS server succesfully:
